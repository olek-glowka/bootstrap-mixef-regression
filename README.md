# bootstrap-mixef-regression

R implementation of bootstrapped mixed-effects regression fit to (partial?) data from Arnon & Snider (2010). Includes bootstrapped hypothesis testing procedures for data transformed under null-hypothesis, as outlined in Davison & Hinkley (1997). Used in meta-analyses reported in my 2018 Linguistics Second Qualifying Paper "Modeling holistic and incremental processing in multi-word chunk comprehension".
